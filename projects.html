      <p>This was a project for my Modern World History class, where my group needed to make a video inspired by crash course about a country affected by the cold war. We wrote a script, and filmed a video about the events of the Congo Crisis. During this project, I learned about the Congo Crisis, as well as writing / filming.</p>
